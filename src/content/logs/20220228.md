* Bought a small selection of model air paints and weathering supplies from Vallejo and AK Interactive. Also picked up a couple components for scratch building. Completely forgot to add Tamiya cement to the order... Annoying.
* May pick up a bottle of Liquitex acrylic ink in Deep Violet or Dioxazine Purple. The Underhive needs more color.
* Still looking for a US supplier with a Roll Maker from Green Stuff World. Starting to feel like I'm in a buy-only phase of the hobby. Definitely a trap of my own making.
* Came across a few great kit-bashes of [Necromunda cultists](http://www.dreadquill.com/meanwhile-on-the-bench-jackal-mask/) and [Underhive citizens](http://www.dreadquill.com/citizens-of-mercy-wip/) from [Dreadquill Publishing.](http://www.dreadquill.com/)
